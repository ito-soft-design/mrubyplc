# mruby/plc

mruby/plc is an experimental project.

I am trying to run a based [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby) program on a PLC (Programmable logic controller).

## Requirement


This gem uses mruby. So you have to install [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby) 3.0 before.  

For installing mruby, refer to the mruby GitHub page.

[The mruby GitHub page](https://github.com/mruby/mruby)

Or use brew, etc.

```
% brew install mruby
```



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mrubyplc'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mrubyplc

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
